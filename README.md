This is a merge from:
1) The official demo torrent :
http://www.projectzomboid.com/test666/ProjectZomboid_PublicTechDemo_0_1_4c.zip.torrent
2) The latest Java Game Library :
http://sourceforge.net/projects/java-game-lib/files/Official%20Releases/LWJGL%202.7.1/
3) Merged both, looked for obscure java launcher examples
4) Profit !
